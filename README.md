# Applied-Numerical-Methods

This repository contains Python implementations of various numerical methods for solving mathematical problems. The methods are organized into different folders according to their topics, such as interpolation, differentiation, integration, linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, and partial differential equations. Each folder contains a Jupyter notebook that explains the theory and the algorithm of the method, as well as some examples and exercises. The notebooks also include interactive widgets that allow the user to change the parameters and see the results.

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a learning resource for students and instructors of numerical methods courses. It can also serve as a reference for anyone who is interested in numerical computing and scientific programming.

## Requirements
To run the notebooks, you need to have Python 3 and Jupyter installed on your system. You also need to install some additional libraries, such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, SymPy, and ipywidgets. You can use pip or conda to install them.

## Usage
To run the notebooks locally, you need to clone or download this repository to your computer. Then, navigate to the repository folder and launch Jupyter:

git clone https://github.com/Kaos599/Applied-Numerical-Methods.git
cd Applied-Numerical-Methods
jupyter notebook
This will open a browser window with a list of folders and files. You can click on any folder to see the notebooks inside it. You can then open any notebook and run the cells by pressing Shift+Enter.

Alternatively, you can run the notebooks online using Binder or Google Colab. You can find the links to these services on the top of each notebook.
